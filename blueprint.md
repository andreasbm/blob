[The blob is waiting for you here](https://appnest-demo.firebaseapp.com/blob/).

## Introduction

During the [February 2019 week 3 #CodePenChallenge](https://codepen.io/challenges/2019/february/3) the theme was blob shapes. I found [this](https://codepen.io/LekovicMilos/full/omVzYv) awesome blob generator and decides to turn it into a reusable web component.

## Usage

Add the `blob-element` to your html and you're ready to go.

```html
<blob-element></blob-element>
```

Remember to give your blob a width and a height. If you want transitions on your blob you can set the `--blob-transition` css variable. Have fun!
